# Playground for Neural Networks

This program is a basic experimenter for simple neural networks. The network implementation used is SNIPE by D. Kriesel (www.dkriesel.com), however, also other network implementations can be used easily by creating corresponding wrapper classes.

## Release Status

This program is experimental. Much parameters can be set in the UI, but the network definition etc. is hard coded. This is intended to be used along with a Java IDE, for experimenting with neural networks.
