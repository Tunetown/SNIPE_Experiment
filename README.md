# Playground for Neural Networks

This program is a basic experimenter for simple neural networks. The network implementation used is SNIPE by D. Kriesel (www.dkriesel.com), however, also other network implementations can be used easily by creating corresponding wrapper classes.

The SNIPE classes are included in the source, so there are no dependencies, also this makes it possible to run the application also with Java versions lower than 7, which is the version the SNIPE jar is compiled with.

## Release Status

This program is experimental. Much parameters can be set in the UI, but the network definition etc. is hard coded. This is intended to be used along with a Java IDE, for experimenting with neural networks.
